<p>Conclusion : In conclusion, the penetration testing report found several vulnerabilities in the "Basic"
 web challenge from HackThisSite.org. These vulnerabilities included hardcoded
 passwords, no password file, location of the password hidden in the source code,
hardcoded credentials within the application, weak encryption and command injection.
 These vulnerabilities could potentially lead to a breach of confidentiality, integrity and
 availability that could result in business, financial or reputational loss for an
 organisation. The report provided recommendations for better securing the web
 application and highlighted the importance of proper web application security. It's
 important to note that regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments can
 help you to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by
 attackers. </p>
